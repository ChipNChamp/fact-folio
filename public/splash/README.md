# Splash Screen Images

This folder contains splash screen images for iOS devices. For a production app, you would need to generate actual splash screen images for different iOS device dimensions.

You can generate these images using tools like:
- https://appsco.pe/developer/splash-screens
- https://www.pwabuilder.com

For now, we're using placeholders in the HTML, but in a production environment, you would replace these with actual images.
